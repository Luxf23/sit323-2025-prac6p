For Task 6.2C of SIT323, I deployed a simple Node.js application to my local Kubernetes cluster using Docker Desktop. I first confirmed that my pods were running correctly using kubectl get pods, and verified that the node-js-deployment had successfully launched two pods in the Running state. Then, I checked the service using kubectl get services, which showed the node-js-service running as a NodePort type, exposing port 80 internally and port 30080 externally. Since there was no external IP, I used the kubectl port-forward command to map the service to my local machine. I ran kubectl port-forward service/node-js-service 8080:80, which allowed me to forward port 80 of the service to port 8080 on my host. After starting the forwarding process, I successfully accessed the Node.js app via http://localhost:8080 and confirmed it was working by seeing the output "Hello World!" in the browser. This confirmed the service deployment and accessibility from the local machine.
